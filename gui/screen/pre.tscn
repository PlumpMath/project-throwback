text = "While working at a secret government lab, an accident lead to several of your co-workers becoming infected by an experimental bio-weapon called, PROJECT THROWBACK. The chemical is designed to revert those infected back to their primal states ... A state of low intellegence, and high agression.

You decide to hold up in a storage room on the ground floor of the facility, only to find one of your infected co-workers hiding there as well. After a struggle, you put a bullet in his head, and are pretty sure you are now infected. Now your only hope for survival is to craft a cure, and escape the facility alive.

Search the facility for the 5 INGREDIENTS, and 5 SUPPLY ITEMS you need, in order to craft a cure for yourself.

Also keep an eye out for MEDKITS, and AMMO BOXES. Good luck!"
